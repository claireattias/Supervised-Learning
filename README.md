This activity uses various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. It uses a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. The activity consists of three parts:

**1. Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Sets**
- Created labels and features from data
- Split the data into training and testing datasets

**2. Creating a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data**
- Fit logistic regression model using training data
- Evaluated model performance by generating a confusion matrix and classification report
  
**3. Writing a Credit Risk Analysis Report**
